    In addition to my work as a developer, I am an avid gamer and and a technical writer. I occasionally stream on <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/crashedfps"><SectionMagic>Twitch</SectionMagic></a>, 
    where I play popular titles like Valorant and Fortnite, showcasing my gameplay skills. As a passionate technical writer, 
    I also contribute to tech community through my blogs on <a href = "https://anubhav1206.hashnode.dev/"><SectionMagic>Hashnode</SectionMagic></a>. 
    I have established myself as a trusted source for web development and technology insights, covering a wide range of topics, from coding tips and tricks to the latest trends in the industry. 
    My in-depth knowledge and ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner have garnered positive feedback from readers.
    Whether it's creating interactive web applications or conquering virtual battlefields, I approach both my development projects and 
    gaming adventures with the same level of enthusiasm, dedication, and problem-solving skills. My goal is to continue contributing to the 
    tech and gaming community through my written content and live streams on Twitch, as I believe that fostering knowledge-sharing and 
    community engagement is vital in these ever-evolving fields. Feel free to check out my latest posts on my Hashnode page, where I 
    strive to inspire and educate fellow developers. And don't forget to drop by my Twitch channel by clicking on the gradient text to watch some of my clutches ðŸ˜‰.
